1. What is the difference between **getElementById, getElementsByClassName, and querySelector / querySelectorAll**?

**Answer:** 

    - By getElementById, we can select a specific element from the DOM with the id.
    - Using getElementsByClassName, we can get all elements of the DOM which are matched with specific class.
    - We use querySelector, when we want to select the first element from the DOM whether it's a class or id.
    - With querySelectorAll, we can get all the elements of the DOM which are matched whether it's a class or id, but it's a good practice to make id unique. We generally use querySelectorAll to select classes.

**getElementsByClassName** returns an HTMLCollection where **querySelectorAll** returns a NodeList.
